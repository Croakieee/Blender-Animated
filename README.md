Project Description:

Create a dynamic animated cube using Blender with added features and tools for an engaging and versatile animation experience.
Additional Features and Tools:

    Particle System Integration:
        Incorporate a particle system to add visual effects like smoke, fire, or sparkles around the moving cube.
        Allow users to customize particle properties through the user interface.

    Camera Movement:
        Implement scripted camera movements to follow the cube or explore the scene dynamically.
        Provide options for users to control or automate camera movements.

    Interactive Timeline:
        Develop an interactive timeline interface within Blender for users to intuitively navigate and manipulate keyframes.
        Allow for easy adjustments to animation timing and sequence.

    Dynamic Backgrounds:
        Introduce dynamic background changes during the animation.
        Allow users to choose from preset backgrounds or upload their own images.

    Physics Simulation:
        Enhance realism by incorporating physics simulations (e.g., gravity, collisions) for the cube.
        Enable users to toggle physics properties and observe their impact on the animation.

    Multi-Cube Interaction:
        Expand the project to support multiple cubes with synchronized or independent animations.
        Include options for users to control the behavior of each cube.

    Keyframe Interpolation:
        Implement advanced keyframe interpolation techniques for smoother animation transitions.
        Provide users with options for adjusting interpolation types.

How to Use:

    Clone the repository to your local machine.
    Open main_animation.blend in Blender to explore and customize the animation.
    Utilize the additional scripts for specific features (e.g., particle_system.py, camera_movement.py).
    Refer to the user guide for detailed instructions on using new functionalities.
